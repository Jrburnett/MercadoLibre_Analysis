Search Trend analysis for MercadoLibre
In this Module I created a bid to drive revenue, that contains data prep, analysis, and visualizations, for all the time series data. 
The first step I took in this challenge is to discover unusual patterns in the data by preparing the data and then caculating the total data and pieces of it in order to find where search trends increase or decrease.
I then grouped the data into hour, day of week, month, and year in order to better understand and read the graphs I created for the data. 
I followed that step by comparing the search trend data to the stock price of the company in order to find patterns in the stock price that correlate to the search trend data.
In the following step I created a time series model using facebook prophet in order to predict future results of the search trends as well as the stock price. 
I then plotted the future time series analysis and was able to answer a few key questions using the data.
